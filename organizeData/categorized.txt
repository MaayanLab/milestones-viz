Generate chromatin accessibility sigtures  for each sample individually by calculating the enrichment of genomic regions relative to a set of control reads from Tn5-treated ked genomic D. Alyze perturb/disease & perturb/control datasets to detecte differentially enriched peaks reflecting changes in chromatin structures as a consequence of perturbation. Generate disease sigtures for future systems alysis and integration with other omics and machine learning alyses.	{'name': 'spil muscular atrophy', 'type': 'disease'}	{"name": "CS00iCTR-n2", "control-or-disease": "control", "type": "iPSC differentiated", "tissue": "brain", "class": "normal"}
