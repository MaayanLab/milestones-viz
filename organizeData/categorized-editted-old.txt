Set up analysis pipelines and perform correlation and clustering tests to determine cell line variability and assay reproducibility  between either technical or biological replicates and Identify potential problematic samples."

Annotate open chromatin regions and map transcription factor binding events in regulatory elements genome-wide. Generate chromatin accessibility signatures  for each sample individually by calculating the enrichment of genomic regions relative to a set of control reads from Tn5-treated naked genomic DNA. Detect differential peaks between disease and control state. Generate disease signatures for future systems analysis and integration with other omics by 1) identifying genes mapping near differential peaks and detecting significantly enriched GO terms for these gene lists; 2) performing DNA foo printing, motif scoring and applying regression methods to infer transcription factors responsible for gene expression signatures."
